# TS-tools

This is the repository corresponding to the TS-tools project.

### Setting up the environment

To set up the ts_tools conda environment:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

To install the TS-tools package, activate the ts-tools environment and run the following command within the TS-tools directory:

```
pip install .
```

Additionally, Gaussian16 needs to be available. In HPC environments, this can typically be achieved by loading the corresponding module to the path:

```
module load gaussian/g16_C01
```

### Generating TS guesses at xTB level-of-theory

TS guesses at xTB level of theory can be generated by running the following command (individual calculations are run in parallel as a single Python ProcessPool):

```
python run_scripts/run_ts_searcher.py [--input-file data/reactions_am.txt] [--xtb-external-path xtb_external_script/xtb_external.py]
```

where the ’input-file’ command line option corresponds to the location of the .txt-file containing the reaction SMILES (the default value ’reactions_am.txt’ corresponds to the benchmarking reactions), 
and the ’xtb-external-path’ option corresponds to the location of the script to use xTB as an external method in Gaussian16 (copied from the Jensen group's [xtb_gaussian](https://github.com/jensengroup/xtb_gaussian/blob/main/xtb_external.py) repository).  

Additional options can also be provided:

1. '--reactive-complex-factors-intra': Specifies a list of floating-point numbers representing reactive complex factors for intra-molecular interactions.
2. '--reactive-complex-factors-inter': Specifies a list of floating-point numbers representing reactive complex factors for inter-molecular interactions.
3. '--solvent': Specifies the name of the solvent (needs to be supported both in xTB and Gaussian16, e.g., 'water')
4. '--freq-cut-off': Specifies the imaginary frequency cut-off used during filtering of plausible starting points for transition state guess optimization.
5. '--target-dir': Specifies the working directory in which all files will be saved; final reactant, product and TS guess geometries (as well as the TS .log file) are saved in another directory with the ’final_’ prefix.

### Validating TS guesses at DFT level of theory  

Validating TS guesses at xTB level-of-theory can be done by running the following command (individual calculations are run in parallel as a single Python ProcessPool):

```
python run_scripts/dft_validation.py [--input-file data/reactions_am.txt] [--input-dir final_work_dir]
``` 

where the ’input-file’ command line option corresponds to the location of the .txt-file containing the reaction SMILES (the default value ’reactions_am.txt’ corresponds to the benchmarking reactions),
and the ’input-dir’ command line option corresponds to the location of the folder in which the final TS guess geometries have been saved (see previous section.

Additional options can also be provided:

1. '--solvent': Specifies the name of the solvent (needs to be supported both in xTB and Gaussian16, e.g., 'water')
2. '--output-dir': Specifies the working directory in which all files will be saved.
3. '--mem': Specifies the memory requested in the Gaussian16 .com files (default is '16GB')
4. '--proc': Specifies the number of processors requested in the Gaussian16 .com files (default is 8) 
5. '--functional': Specifies the functional to be used for the DFT calculations (default is 'UB3LYP')
6. '--basis-set': Specifies the basis set to be used for the DFT calculations (default is '6-31G**')

### Generating TS guesses at DFT level of theory

TS guesses at DFT level-of-theory (from an xTB reactive path) can be generated by running the following command (individual calculations are run in parallel as a single Python ProcessPool):

```
python run_scripts/run_ts_searcher_dft.py [--input-file data/reactions_am.txt] [--xtb-external-path xtb_external_script/xtb_external.py]
```

where the ’input-file’ command line option corresponds to the location of the .txt-file containing the reaction SMILES (the default value ’reactions_am.txt’ corresponds to the benchmarking reactions),
and the ’xtb-external-path’ option corresponds to the location of the script to use xTB as an external method in Gaussian16 (copied from the Jensen group's [xtb_gaussian](https://github.com/jensengroup/xtb_gaussian/blob/main/xtb_external.py) repository).
Note that this script will be a lot slower than xTB optimization of TSs, and should consequently only be used when full xTB level-of-theory TS guess generation fails.

Additional options can also be provided:

1. '--reactive-complex-factors-intra': Specifies a list of floating-point numbers representing reactive complex factors for intra-molecular interactions.
2. '--reactive-complex-factors-inter': Specifies a list of floating-point numbers representing reactive complex factors for inter-molecular interactions.
3. '--solvent': Specifies the name of the solvent (needs to be supported both in xTB and Gaussian16, e.g., 'water')
4. '--freq-cut-off': Specifies the imaginary frequency cut-off used during filtering of plausible starting points for transition state guess optimization.
5. '--target-dir': Specifies the working directory in which all files will be saved; final reactant, product and TS guess geometries (as well as the TS .log file) are saved in another directory with the ’final_’ prefix.
6. '--mem': Specifies the memory requested in the Gaussian16 .com files (default is '16GB')
7. '--proc': Specifies the number of processors requested in the Gaussian16 .com files (default is 8)
8. '--functional': Specifies the functional to be used for the DFT calculations (default is 'UB3LYP')
9. '--basis-set': Specifies the basis set to be used for the DFT calculations (default is '6-31G**')
